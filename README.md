# SQL Queries Repository

This repository contains 15 SQL queries written and tested on three datasets:
- **Cricket**
- **FoodPanda**
- **CO (Customers/Orders)**

All queries are stored in the `Essential SQL Commands.sql` file.  
Below is a short description of each query along with the dataset it belongs to.
